# Breadcrumb
A dynamic, highly customizable breadcrumbs component for Next.js.  Breadcrumbs are fixed in the Layout Component. If you need flexiblity in placement use `TailoredBreadcrumb`

The component needs to be used within Next.js and won't work in plain React. It will always display a dynamic Breadcrumb navigation, based on the current path of the Next router.

### Import

import { Breadcrumb } from "components/navigation";
